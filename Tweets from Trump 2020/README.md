This project tracks the tweets from US President Donald Trumps twitter account since the beginning of 2020. Known for his abysmal response to
the coronavirus, his constant provocations for anyone who doesn't agree with him, the supposed conspiracy of "Obamagate" and alleged
voter fraud from the oppsing party, and most recently, his handling of the protests in the wake of recent police brutality against Black men.
This project covers the words that appear most frequently from Trump tweets, as well as mentions and hashtags the president tends to use.
