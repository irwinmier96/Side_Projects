In response to the recent pandemic, this project tracks the news related to the coronavrius pandemic in Canada. 
The dataset from Kaggle is analyzed to see what the buzzwords for the pandemic are in Canadian news. 
Much of the text comes from sources like CBC and other local Canadian news publishers, and
details how the news are responding and reporting the pandemic not only in Canada,
but how the pandemic is being dealt with internationally.
